mel_network.R uses the stoichiometry of yeast central carbon metabolism and directly added reactions
to construct the stoichiometry of drosophila glycolysis/TCA cycle/PPP/FAS/beta-oxidation and shuttles.

mel_FBA.R uses estimates of line/population-specific Vmaxes and gas-exchange rates to constraint
a quadratic programming optimization task.

min  Av = b
s.t. Sv = 0
	Gv < h

S is drosophila_stoi.R
A specifies the gas-exchange reactions
b is the empirically determined rates of gas-exchange
G specifies bounded fluxes
h specifies the maximal/minimal allowable flux due to experimentally-measured Vmaxes and reaction irreversibility







For older code:

resp8.1 - 
gases are in 10^-7 liters per fly-hour
flight -
units are standard, m/s, m/s2 ...
enzyme kinetics -
units are OD/s, converted to moles/s using beer-lambert and then corrected for the fraction of
the fly extract that goes into an assay plate (i.e. mmoles/s per 1/50th of a set of 5 flies)
