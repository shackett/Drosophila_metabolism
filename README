mel_network.R uses the stoichiometry of yeast central carbon metabolism and directly added reactions
to construct the stoichiometry of drosophila glycolysis/TCA cycle/PPP/FAS/beta-oxidation and shuttles.

mel_FBA.R uses estimates of line/population-specific Vmaxes and gas-exchange rates to constraint
a quadratic programming optimization task.

min  Av = b
s.t. Sv = 0
	 Gv < h
	 
	 S is drosophila_stoi.R
	 A specifies the gas-exchange reactions
	 b is the empirically determined rates of gas-exchange
	 G specifies bounded fluxes
	 h specifies the maximal/minimal allowable flux due to experimentally-measured Vmaxes and
	 reaction irreversibility
